            Ingredients
            2-3 large eggs
            Salt, to taste
            Pepper, to taste
            1 tablespoon of butter or oil
            Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
            Instructions
            Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
            You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
            Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
            Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
            the eggs evenly coat the surface.
            Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
            middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
            Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
            fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
